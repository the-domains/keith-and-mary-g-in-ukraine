January 2016- Three years in Kyiv and now we are back in the USA.  But just for a short while (hopefully).  We believe Ukraine is where we belong and can minister.  So we will become Career Missionary Associates.  It means increasing our budget a little and that's why we are back in the States.  

We will be working hard to return to Kyiv by September 1, 2016\.  When we return we will continue the work we started.  We see ourselves involved in two important tasks- 

1\.  Church Planting-There are 30 cities with populations from 10,000-50,000 people that have no evangelical churches.  Obviously, an important task is to establish the church where it is not.  We will Support, Encourage, and Train pastors as they start new churches throughout Ukraine.  

2\.  International Christian Assembly, ICA-An estimated 50,000 expats (foreigners) live in Ukraine, mostly in Kyiv and many English speaking.  We will continue to reach out to this "migrant" population to give them a Christian community where they can connect.  ICA also provides the platform for Chi Alpha College ministry, Teen Challenge Coffee House ministry, The City Youth ministry, and Arabic Congregation ministry.
