January 2016- Three years in Kyiv and now we are back in the USA.  But just for a short while (hopefully).  We believe Ukraine is where we belong and can minister.  So we will become Career Missionary Associates.  It means increasing our budget a little and that's why we are back in the States.  

We are working hard
to return to Kyiv by September 1, 2016\.  When we return we will continue
the work we started.  We see ourselves involved in two important
tasks- 

1\.
 Church Planting-There are 30 cities with populations from 10,000-50,000
people that have no evangelical churches.  An important task is
to establish the church where it is not.  We will Support, Encourage, and
Train pastors as they start new churches throughout Ukraine.  Much of our time will be spent coaching these pastors as they develop their leadership skills.

2\.
 International Christian Assembly, ICA-An estimated 50,000 expats
(foreigners) live in Ukraine, mostly in Kyiv and many English speaking.
 We will continue to reach out to this "migrant" population to
give them a Christian community where they can connect.  ICA also provides
the platform for Chi Alpha College ministry, Teen Challenge Coffee House
ministry, The City Youth ministry, and Arabic Congregation ministry.
